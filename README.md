Using selenium for automation on Facebook

This is for people who want to see how automation works or people like me who are just too lazy to type in their username and password everytime they want to go online on facebook using incognito mode.

Well you need to have selenium installed and you need to have a web browser engine for automation for firefox or Chrome all you have to do is download the zip file, extract it then paste the file path in your system variables i would leave a link below .

To get selenium installed all you have to do is:
pip install selenium
